    The encryption/decryption key is stored here because this is a personal or demo project, 
    which I use as a showcase of knowledge, storing the key in appsettings.json is fine in this 
    context but let's be aware that in production this would not be ideal.

    Ideally it should be stored in a keyvault or keystore.
